= {project-full} 2.3

You can migrate virtual machines (VMs) from VMware vSphere or {rhv-full} to {virt} with {the-lc} {project-first}.

The release notes describe technical changes, new features and enhancements, and known issues.

[id="technical-changes-23_{context}"]
== Technical changes

This release has the following technical changes:

.Setting the VddkInitImage path is part of the procedure of adding VMware provider.

In the web console, you enter the VddkInitImage path when adding a VMware provider. Alternatively, from the CLI, you add the VddkInitImage path to the `Provider` CR for VMware migrations.

.The StorageProfile resource needs to be updated for a non-provisioner storage class

You must update the `StorageProfile` resource with `accessModes` and `volumeMode` for non-provisioner storage classes such as NFS. The documentation includes a link to the relevant procedure.

[id="new-features-and-enhancements-23_{context}"]
== New features and enhancements

This release has the following features and improvements:

.{project-short} {project-version} supports warm migration from {rhv-short}

You can use warm migration to migrate VMs from both VMware and {rhv-short}.

.The minimal sufficient set of privileges for VMware users is established

VMware users do not have to have full `cluster-admin` privileges to perform a VM migration. The minimal sufficient set of user's privileges is established and documented.

.{project-short} documentation is updated with instructions on using hooks

{project-short} documentation includes instructions on adding hooks to migration plans and running hooks on VMs.

[id="known-issues-23_{context}"]
== Known issues

This release has the following known issues:

.Some warm migrations from {rhv-short} might fail

When you run a migration plan for warm migration of multiple VMs from {rhv-short}, the migrations of some VMs might fail during the cutover stage. In that case, restart the migration plan and set the cutover time for the VM migrations that failed in the first run. link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2063884[(*BZ#2063884*)]

.Snapshots are not deleted after warm migration

The Migration Controller service does not delete snapshots automatically after a successful warm migration of a {rhv-short} VM. You can link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.9/html-single/virtualization/index#virt-deleting-vm-snapshot-web_virt-managing-vm-snapshots[delete the snapshots manually]. link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2053183[(*BZ#22053183*)]

.Warm migration from {rhv-short} fails if a snapshot operation is performed on the source VM

If the user performs a snapshot operation on the source VM at the time when a migration snapshot is scheduled, the migration fails instead of waiting for the user's snapshot operation to finish. link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2057459[(*BZ#2057459*)]

.During a {rhv-short} warm migration, the status of the target VM becomes DataVolumeError

During a warm migration from {rhv-short}, the status of the target VM might become *DataVolumeError*. The cause is a restart of the `importer` pod. This does not affect the migration. link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2055201[(*BZ#2055201*)]

.QEMU guest agent is not installed on migrated VMs

The QEMU guest agent is not installed on migrated VMs. Workaround: Install the QEMU guest agent with a post-migration hook. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2018062[*BZ#2018062*])

.Deleting migration plan does not remove temporary resources.

Deleting a migration plan does not remove temporary resources such as `importer` pods, `conversion` pods, config maps, secrets, failed VMs and data volumes. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2018974[*BZ#2018974*]) You must archive a migration plan before deleting it in order to clean up the temporary resources.

.Unclear error status message for VM with no operating system

The error status message for a VM with no operating system on the *Migration plan details* page of the web console does not describe the reason for the failure. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2008846[*BZ#2008846*])

.Log archive file includes logs of a deleted migration plan or VM

If you delete a migration plan and then run a new migration plan with the same name or if you delete a migrated VM and then remigrate the source VM, the log archive file created by the {project-short} web console might include the logs of the deleted migration plan or VM. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2023764[*BZ#2023764*])
