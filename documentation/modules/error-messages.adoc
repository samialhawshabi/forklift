.warm import retry limit reached

The `warm import retry limit reached` error message is displayed during a warm migration if a VMware virtual machine (VM) has reached the maximum number (28) of changed block tracking (CBT) snapshots during the precopy stage. You must delete some of the CBT snapshots from the VM and restart the migration plan.
