= Migration plan options

On the *Migration plans* page of the {project-short} web console, you can click the {kebab} beside a migration plan to access the following options:

* *Edit*: Edit the details of a migration plan. You cannot edit a migration plan while it is running or after it has completed successfully.
* *Duplicate*: Create a new migration plan with the same virtual machines (VMs), parameters, mappings, and hooks as an existing plan. You can use this feature for the following tasks:

** Migrate VMs to a different namespace.
** Edit an archived migration plan.
** Edit a migration plan with a different status, for example, failed, canceled, running, critical, or ready.

* *Archive*: Delete the logs, history, and metadata of a migration plan. The plan cannot be edited or restarted. It can only be viewed.
+
[NOTE]
====
The *Archive* option is irreversible. However, you can duplicate an archived plan.
====

* *Delete*: Permanently remove a migration plan. You cannot delete a running migration plan.
+
[NOTE]
====
The *Delete* option is irreversible.

Deleting a migration plan does not remove temporary resources such as `importer` pods, `conversion` pods, config maps, secrets, failed VMs, and data volumes. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2018974[*BZ#2018974*]) You must archive a migration plan before deleting it in order to clean up the temporary resources.
====

* *View details*: Display the details of a migration plan.
* *Restart*: Restart a failed or canceled migration plan.
* *Cancel scheduled cutover*: Cancel a scheduled cutover migration for a warm migration plan.
